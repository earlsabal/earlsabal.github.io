	<h1>Earl's Art</h1>
	<p>I am an artist who enjoys painting during my free time.  I use acrylic paint and usually paint on canvases indoors, however I do enjoy painting outdoors as well.  The origin of my desire to paint, was to touch and <em>impact</em> people's emotions with my art.  I originally called my paintings part of "<strong>The Saddest Lie Projects</strong>."</p>
