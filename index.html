	<h1>Earl's Art</h1>
	<p>I am an artist who enjoys painting during my free time.  I use acrylic paint and usually paint on canvases indoors, however I do enjoy painting outdoors as well.  The origin of my desire to paint, was to touch and <strong>impact</strong> people's emotions with my art.  I originally called my paintings part of "<em>The Saddest Lie Projects</em>."</p>

	<h2>This is my first painting</h2>
	<img src="First_painting.png">
	<p>This is the first painting I made and currently the logo to "<em>The Saddest Lie Projects</em>." I was going through a lot at the time and this is what my imagination came up with.  Feel free to interpret it however you like, but please do tell me how it made <strong>you</strong> feel at the bottom.</p>

	

	<h2>Other related Hobbies</h2>
	<p>I also enjoy drawing, it's actually what I did before painting</p>
